  # Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
    My motivation was to use this project as a template for learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
    I built this project to become familiar with Gitbash, Github, and beginner programming concepts as well as using this project as a testing site for different lines of code, trials and errors.
- What problem does it solve?
    The problem this project solves is to establish my learning development of coding to ensure I know how to use all the basic tools in coding and dip my feet in the basic programming languages.
- What did you learn?
    I learned basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript programming languages. I learned the importance of saving and using branches before merging the final code into the main branch. I learned the importance of linking files like script.js to index.html or else the console wouldn't show anything if they are not linked. I also learned (through difficulty) how saving the project in VS compared to Gitbash differs and if anything is not in the file correctly it just won't save properly. I had to save manually via Github instead of Gitbash to fix the errors. So I need to continue practicing Gitbash commands and properly saving after each revision.

## Usage

    This is just a study guide showing what I learned and basic javascript functions working in the console. This can be used as a reference of what the study guide project is supposed to look like in a web browser.

## Credits

## License

Please refer to the LICENSE in the repo.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
